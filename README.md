# Simple-Messaging-Django-Email

Documentation coming soon.

Note that this is NOT a standalone package, but instead extends [Simple-Messaging-Django](https://github.com/audacious-software/Simple-Messaging-Django) with e-mail capabilities in addition to that package's original support for SMS and MMS on the Twilio and Azure Communication Services platforms.

E-mail [chris@audacious-software.com](mailto:chris@audacious-software.com) if you have any questions about a release timeline.
